# septic tank overflow sensor

I had a problem with the pump because I couldn't see when it stopped working. The pump overload fuse stopped working and the tank filled with sewage. The septic tank overflowed several times. Therefore, using the elements, I developed a sensor that, if a certain level of liquid in the tank is exceeded, sends me a message on WhatsApp. The repository below contains a list of elements from which I made the sensor along with the connection.

### List of elements:
- ESP8266
- Waveshare 9525
- UTP cat.5e U/UTP 4x2x0.5 Alantec gel-filled outdoor cable
- box make on 3D printer
- epoxy grout

### Connection:
- ESP8266 D1 -> Waveshare 9525 OUT
- ESP8266 VCC -> Waveshare 9525 VCC
- ESP8266 GND -> Waveshare 9525 GND
