# septic tank overflow sensor

I had a problem with the pump because I couldn't see when it stopped working. The pump overload fuse stopped working and the tank filled with sewage. The septic tank overflowed several times. Therefore, using the elements, I developed a sensor that, if a certain level of liquid in the tank is exceeded, sends me a message on WhatsApp. The repository below contains a list of elements from which I made the sensor along with the connection.
